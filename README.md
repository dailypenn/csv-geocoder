CSV Geocoder
================

Usage
---------------

This geocoder requires a Google API key. Set your API key using an environment variable:
```shell
export API_KEY=[your key]
```
(If you don't know what key to use, ask the Director of Web Development.)

You'll also need to install two modules: `pandas` and `googlemaps`.
```shell
pip install wheel
pip install pandas
pip install -U googlemaps
```

To run the program, make sure your input CSV file has a column called `address` and then run the following command in the same directory as `geocoder.py`:
```shell
python geocoder.py [file_name.csv]
```

The results will be output to a file called `geocoded_[file_name].csv` â€“ the name of your original file with `geocoded_` prepended.
